It permits geospatial analysis at scale.\n\n### The set up of GEE\n\nGEE has a image data as a raster(has bands) and Feature as a vector. Feature has geometry and attributes. Furthermore, Image stack called ImageCollection annd Feature stack called FeatureCollection.\n\nGEE uses javascript(one of website programming language)\n\n#### Client vs Server\n\nWithin GEE we have code that runs on the client side and server side. Client side is the browser. Server side is on the server where data is stored. Any thing that has ***ee*** in front of it is stored on the server.\n\n![](images/paste-1097464A.png)\n\nSource: [pintrest/codeboxx](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/764837949191948083/)\n\n#### Scale\n\nScale in GEE refers to pixel resolution. It is set by the output(not by input). GEE collects the image to fit a 256x256 grid and GEE select the pyramid with the closest scale to that of your analysis and re-samples as needed. When we do re-sample, it uses nearest neighbor by default.\n\n![](images/paste-80D175DE.png)\n\nScale. Source: [GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale)\n\nLet's see an example, first load an image\n\nvar image = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1/LC08_044034_20140318'); var rgbVis = { bands: \\['B4', 'B3', 'B2'\\], min: 5964.56, max: 11703.44 }; Map.addLayer(image, rgbVis, \"Landsat 8\");\n\nScale. Source: [GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale)\n\nNext, select a band 4 and then change the scale\n\nvar band_4 = image.select('B4'); var printAtScale = function(scale) { print('Pixel value at'+scale+' meters scale', band_4.reduceRegion({ reducer: ee.Reducer.first(), geometry: band_4.geometry().centroid(), // The scale determines the pyramid level from which to pull the input scale: scale }).get('B4')); }; printAtScale(10); // 8883 printAtScale(30); // 8883 printAtScale(50); // 8337 printAtScale(70); // 9215 printAtScale(200); // 8775 printAtScale(500); // 8300 Copy Code\n\nSource: [Code example](https://code.earthengine.google.com/82d6c28210a115f2446c0ca8e7a65e51)\n\n#### Projection\n\nGEE converts all data into the Mercator projection(EPSG:3867). As a result, the operations of the projection are decided by the output.\n\n![](images/paste-1BDFAF9D.png)\n\nSource: [GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/projections)\n\n### GEE in action(how we use it)\n\n#### Building blocks of GEE\n\nObject can be vector, raster, feature, string and number. Each of objects belong to a class and each class have specific functions.\n\n![](images/paste-313B53C6.png)\n\nSource: [GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/objects_methods_overview)\n\n#### What does GEE look like\n\n![](images/paste-59C13A06.png)\n\nSource: [Form of GEE](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0023-lecture-5/#31)\n\n#### Typical processes in GEE\n\nAfter we have lots of images(raster data) and these belong to an imagecollection. We can process geometry operations, methods and applications.\n\n-   Geometry operations\n\n    -   Joins\n\n    -   Zonal statistics\n\n    -   Filtering of images or specific values\n\n-   Methods\n\n    -   Machine learning\n\n    -   Supervised and unsupervised classification\n\n    -   Deep learning with Tensor Flow\n\n    -   Exploring relationship between variables\n\n    -   Exploring relationship between variables\n\n-   Applications\n\n    -   Online charts\n\n    -   Scalable geopspatial applications with GEE data\n\n    -   These let us query the data with a user interface that then updates the results\n\n#### Reducing images by region\n\nWe load an image collection from a dates and place and want to reduce the collection to the extreme values for each pixel. In GEE this is termed **reduceRegion().** If we want to use feature collection with many polygons we can do it by **image.reduceRegions().**\n\n![](images/paste-E4392F67.png)\n\nSource: [GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/reducers_reduce_region)\n\n#### Reducing images by neighbourhoods\n\nWe can use image neighbors instead of using polygons to reduce the collection.\n\n![](images/paste-22B32BD6.png)\n\nSource: [GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/reducers_reduce_neighborhood)\n\n#### Joins and filtering\n\nWe can **join** image collections and feature collections. To use joins we have to put them within a **filter**.\n\n-   The `leftField` is the index (or attribute) in the primary data\n\n-   The `rightField` is the secondary data\n\n## Applications\n\nGoogle Earth Engine is used in so many different fields and is very useful. This has made remote sensing analysis faster and more accessible.(M. AmaniÂ *et al*. ,[2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9184118)). However, I consider environmental monitoring to be the most powerful application of them all. Environmental monitoring allows us to track land use change, monitor deforestation, detect floods, and detect damage. It can also monitor air quality, surface temperature, water quality, crop patterns and soil health.\n\n## Personal Reflection\n\nThis week we learned about Google Earth Engine (GEE). In fact, before I studied GEE, I had Google Earth installed on my personal computer. The reason is that I wanted to see landmarks around the world through 3D building information provided by Google. At this time, for the first time, I found out that Google Earth is basically using LandSAT8(What we learned in previous week) satellite images for the entire earth, although it varies depending on the region. In this lecture, I created GEE account and personally experienced its advantages. I was surprised by the fact that if you sign up for GEE, you can program yourself and that anyone can view satellite data from around the world free of charge. I was also surprised that there was an easy to follow instruction manual.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"week5.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Introduction to Google Earth Engine","author":"Sohyun Park"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"week5.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Introduction to Google Earth Engine","author":"Sohyun Park"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
