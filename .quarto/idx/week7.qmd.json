How can we classify it? Subpixel analysis overcome this limitation by estimating the proportion of different land cover types within each pixel.\n\n![](images/paste-BAB118A3.png)\n\nSource:[MacLachlan et al. 2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01431161.2017.1346403?needAccess=true&)\n\n### Accuracy assessment\n\nAccuracy is important because it determines the quality of the information. So, after producing and output wee need to assign a accuracy value to it(common to machine learning).\n\nIn remote sensing we focus on:\n\n-   **Producer accuracy**: the fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP) compared to ground truth data(TP+FN)\n\n-   **User accuracy**: the fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP) relative to all others classified as a particular land cover(TP+FP)\n\n-   **Overall accuracy**: epresents the combined fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP +TN) across all land cover types (TP+FP+FN+TN)\n\n    ![](images/paste-FF761340.png)\n\nSource:[Barsi et al. 2018 Accuracy Dimensions in Remote Sensing](https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3/61/2018/isprs-archives-XLII-3-61-2018.pdf)\n\n### Spatial cross validation\n\n-   Spatially partition the folded data\n\n-   Dealing with spatial autocorrelation by using k-means clustering in each fold\n\n-   Support Vector Machine\n\n-   Not available in GEE (but available in R)\n\n    ![](images/paste-8645EBBF.png)\n\nSpatial visualization of selected test and training observations for cross-validation of one repetition.

This study focuses on three test areas and uses various remote sensing data such as satellite imagery and land use/land cover maps to extract information related to landslide occurrence. After calculating 10 factors such as soil type and land cover, this study applies a multivariate logistic regression model to model the relationship between landslide occurrence and environmental variables by cross-validating the three research areas. The authors emphasized that this model developed using remote sensing and GIS is effective in identifying and mapping landslide risk areas, and the importance of cross-validation as a means of testing the accuracy of the model.\n\n\n## Personal Reflection\n\nThis week we learned advanced classifier methods and indicators for accuracy assessmennt. I really enjoyed to try out landcover classification on GEE in the practical. However, on the other hand, \bI thought that the technology to accurately detect and classify objects using these innovative methods could be abused and endanger human life or privacy. Of course, most of these technologies are used in good ways to improve the environment and the quality of life of citizens. However, after learning about ethics as a data scientist in the first semester and learning examples of side effects caused by data processing and misuse of technology, this week's lecture gave me an opportunity to think about it once again.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"week7.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Classification2","author":"Sohyun Park"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"week7.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Classification2","author":"Sohyun Park"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
