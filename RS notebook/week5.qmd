## Summary

In this week, we will figure out "What is Google Earth Engine(GEE)" and

GEE is "Geospatial" processing service. It permits geospatial analysis at scale.

### The set up of GEE

GEE has a image data as a raster(has bands) and Feature as a vector. Feature has geometry and attributes. Furthermore, Image stack called ImageCollection annd Feature stack called FeatureCollection.

Gee uses javascript(one of website programming language)

{// Use curly brackets {} to make a dictionary of key:value pairs.} var object = { foo: 'bar', baz: 13, stuff: \['this', 'that', 'the other thing'\] }; print('Print foo:', object\['foo'\]);

#### Client vs Server

Within GEE we have code that runs on the client side and server side. Client side is the browser. Server side is on the server where data is stored. Any thing that has ***ee*** in front of it is stored on the server.

#### Scale

Scale in GEE refers to pixel resolution. It is set by the output(not by input). GEE collects the image to fit a 256x256 grid and GEE select the pyramid with the closest scale to that of your analysis and re-samples as needed. When we do re-sample, it uses nearest neighbor by default.

Let's see an example, first load an image

var image = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1/LC08_044034_20140318'); var rgbVis = { bands: \['B4', 'B3', 'B2'\], min: 5964.56, max: 11703.44 }; Map.addLayer(image, rgbVis, "Landsat 8");

Next, select a band 4 and then change the scale

var band_4 = image.select('B4'); var printAtScale = function(scale) { print('Pixel value at'+scale+' meters scale', band_4.reduceRegion({ reducer: ee.Reducer.first(), geometry: band_4.geometry().centroid(), // The scale determines the pyramid level from which to pull the input scale: scale }).get('B4')); }; printAtScale(10); // 8883 printAtScale(30); // 8883 printAtScale(50); // 8337 printAtScale(70); // 9215 printAtScale(200); // 8775 printAtScale(500); // 8300 Copy Code

#### Projection

GEE converts all data into the Mercator projection(EPSG:3867). As a result, the operations of the projection are decided by the output.

### GEE in action(how we use it)

#### Building blocks of GEE

Object can be vector, raster, feature, string and number. Each of objects belong to a class and each class have specific functions.

#### What does GEE look like

#### Typical processes in GEE

After we have lots of images(raster data) and these belong to an imagecollection. We can process geometry operations, methods and applications.

-   Geometry operations

    -   Joins

    -   Zonal statistics

    -   Filtering of images or specific values

-   Methods

    -   Machine learning

    -   Supervised and unsupervised classification

    -   Deep learning with Tensor Flow

    -   Exploring relationship between variables

    -   Exploring relationship between variables

-   Applications

    -   Online charts

    -   Scalable geopspatial applications with GEE data

    -   These let us query the data with a user interface that then updates the results

#### Reducing images by region

#### Reducing images by neighbourhoods

#### Regression

#### Joins and filtering

## Applications
