## Summary

This week is about basic of Reomote Sensing. It is about "What is reomote sensing?" and about "how it works".

### What is remote sensing?

NASA defines remote sensing as **acquiring information from a distance**

Remote sensing is a technology that obtains information from a distance without contact with the observed object. It uses electromagnetic waves reflected or emitted from objects to investigate the components, types, and states of objects. In the case of ocean remote sensing, ocean currents can be estimated by measuring water temperature with an infrared sensor of an artificial satellite, the structure of upwelling or eddies can be identified, and the ocean circulation structure can also be understood. In the case of meteorological remote sensing, cloud temperature, classification, dust, ozone content, wind speed, etc. can be observed. Remote sensing is also used to monitor glacier and volcanic activity, and to study abnormal climate caused by El Ni√±o.

### Type of sensors

When we use Remote sensing we have to collet data by various of sensors. We can collect data by

-   Satellites

-   Phones(aerial imagery)

-   Drones

-   Phones

-   Free standing on the ground or sea

### Two types of remote sensing sensors

There are two Type of sensors; Passive sensors and Active sensors. Let's see more specifically.

### Passive sensors

This sensors don't emit anytning and use energy that is available. And they detecting reflected energy(in electromagnetic waves) from the sun. For example, human eye, camera and satellite sonsor.

### Active sensors

This type of sensors have an energy source for illumination and actively emits electormagnetic waves and then waits to receive. Electromagnetic radiation propagates as waves. So we can see through clouds, volcanic ash, atmospheric conditions and also collect data at night. Such as Radar, X-ray and LiDAR.

### Causes of bidirectional reflectance distribution functions

Sensors collect data from energy being reflected from the surface that is smooth or diffuse. When electromagnetic waves are reflected from the surface , the waves can be linked to surface properties - roughness, shape, orientation, moisture, salinity and density. Furthermore, SAR data less commonly documented surface interactions.

### Explore the 4 resolutions of remotely sensed data

Remotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions.

1.  Spatial

    It is the size of the raster cells(grid per pixels). It's range between 10cm and several kilometers.

2.  Spectral

    Images seen by the human eye are perceived as wavelengths of red, green, and blue, which are visible light rays. A color different from the wavelength reflected by the object is recognized as the color absorbed. However, we are subject to the constraints of the atmospheric window (water vapor, ozone, carbon dioxide and atmospheric molecules block part of the spectrum). Therefore, we can observe it only where it is not absorbed by the atmosphere.

    We classify the type or spectral resolution according to the number of bands we observe. Each band is usually provided as a separate raster layer. This means that the spectral signature can be either discrete or continuous.

3.  Temporal

    This means that the revisit time of the sensor needs to be considered. For example, return visit times are daily, every 7 days or upon request. Also, lower resolution means larger pixels.

4.  Radiometric

    The ability of a sensor to identify and display small differences in energy. Higher means more sensitive.

    -   8 bits = 256 possible values

    -   4 bits = 16 possible values

Furthermore, we have to consider type of orbit. There are two type of orbits. First, geosynchronous orbit (GSO) is that satellite matches the Earth's rotation. Second, geostationary orbit, this orbit holds same position, usually only for communications but some sensors are geostationary.
