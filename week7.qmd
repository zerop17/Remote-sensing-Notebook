## Summary

This week covered more classification methods, how to assess accuracy of classifers and importance of accounting for spatial dependence in classifiers.

### Object-based image analysis(OBIA)

-   Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) Algorithm = the most common method for superpixel generation

-   Supercells are consider shapes (rather than cells) based on the homogeneity or heterogeneity of cells

-   Consists of two parts; Segmentation and classification

-   **Segmentation:** OBIA segments an image grouping small pixels together into vector objects based on similarityÂ

### Sub pixel classification(Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA)/ Linear spectral unmixing)

What if we have **a range of land cover types within one pixel**? How can we classify it? Subpixel analysis overcome this limitation by estimating the proportion of different land cover types within each pixel.

### Accuracy assessment

Accuracy is important because it determines the quality of the information. So, after producing and output wee need to assign a accuracy value to it(common to machine learning).

In remote sensing we focus on:

-   **Producer accuracy**: the fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP) compared to ground truth data(TP+FN)

-   **User accuracy**: the fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP) relative to all others classified as a particular land cover(TP+FP)

-   **Overall accuracy**: epresents the combined fraction of correctly classified pixels (TP +TN) across all land cover types (TP+FP+FN+TN)

### Spatial cross validation

-   Spatially partition the folded data

-   Dealing with spatial autocorrelation by using k-means clustering in each fold

-   Support Vector Machine

-   Not available in GEE (but available in R)

## Applications

## Personal Reflection

This week we learned advanced classifier methods and indicators for accuracy assessmennt. I really enjoyed to try out landcover classification on GEE in the practical. However, on the other hand, I thought that the technology to accurately detect and classify objects using these innovative methods could be abused and endanger human life or privacy. Of course, most of these technologies are used in good ways to improve the environment and the quality of life of citizens. However, after learning about ethics as a data scientist in the first semester and learning examples of side effects caused by data processing and misuse of technology, this week's lecture gave me an opportunity to think about it once again.
