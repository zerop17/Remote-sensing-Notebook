## Summary

This week\'s lecture we will learn aboutUrban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenom through several policy case studies in different cities and countries.

### What is Urban Heat Island?

-   Urban areas obtain comparatively higher atmospheric and surface temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to human activitiesÂ

-   There is two main factors

    -   More dark surfaces that retain heat

    -   Less vegetation that cools the environment

-   Basic solution is making more green spaces in urban area

-   In Barcelona, they have implemented '**Superblocks'** startegy

    -   Increase pedestrian traffic

    -   Reduce nitrogen oxide

    -   Reduce noise pollurion

    -   Increase business

-   In western Sydney, they have implemented '**Cool Roads Trail'** startegy

    -   Surface coating did not systematically reduce air temperature during the day or night

    -   Ambient air temperatures were not lowered as a result of coating roads and carparks, which can potentially be a matter of scale

### What data do we need?

-   EO data(eg.Landsat 8 TIRS Collection 2)

-   Meteorological data(Temperature/Wind/Precipitation)

-   Spatial data from OpenStreetMap

-   Census data

### Making sense of this

Before implement the policy, we have to think about equal access/ distribution or equitable access / distribution or providing environmental justice.
