## Summary

This week\'s lecture we will learn aboutUrban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenom through several policy case studies in different cities and countries.

### What is Urban Heat Island?

-   Urban areas obtain comparatively higher atmospheric and surface temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to human activitiesÂ

-   Basic solution is making more green spaces in urban area

-   In Barcelona, they have implemented '**Superblocks'** startegy

    -   Increase pedestrian traffic

    -   Reduce nitrogen oxide

    -   Reduce noise pollurion

    -   Increase business

-   In western Sydney, they have implemented '**Cool roads trail'** startegy

    -   Reflective carparks to reduce surface temperatures

    -   Reduce nitrogen oxide

    -   Reduce noise pollurion

    -   Increase business
